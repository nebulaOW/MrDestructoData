# Map Data for MrDestructo
Credit goes to DiaZ/AOD for creating MrDestructo.  
I decided to create map data for each map. I've included the entire subroutine.  
I know for sure this will work with Hax Framework.  

## INSTALLATION:
### STEP ONE:
1. Copy the contents of the applicable map .txt file from the [Maps](/Maps/) folder.
